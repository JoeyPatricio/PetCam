# 🐇 PetCam (Bunny Tracker)

A self-hosted machine-learning pet monitor. A camera watches your rabbits, a
classifier recognizes what they're doing — zoomies, yawning, grooming, standing,
or resting — and you get an email with a clip when something noteworthy happens.

Live demo: **https://bunny-tracker.app** (public demo view; the live stream is
private to the owner).

## How it works

```
[camera] ──► capture agent (ffmpeg) ──► MobileNetV2 embedding ──► classifier ──► behavior
                  │                                                        │
                  ├──► rolling 12s clips                                   ├──► email alert + clip
                  └──► MJPEG live stream ──► dashboard                     └──► public text feed
```

- **Capture agent** (`server/agent/capture.mjs`) — a headless Node service that
  reads the camera with one `ffmpeg` process, sampling a frame every few seconds
  for inference, recording rolling clips, and pushing a live MJPEG stream. Runs
  the same on a PC (`dshow`) or a Raspberry Pi (`v4l2`) — only two `.env` lines change.
- **Classifier** — MobileNetV2 transfer learning in TensorFlow.js. A dense head
  trained on 150+ hand-labeled clips maps 1280-dim embeddings to five behaviors
  (~81% validation accuracy). Train it from the browser in the Training tab.
- **Alerts** — a non-normal behavior emails you the clip (Nodemailer + Gmail),
  with motion gating, a multi-frame debounce, and a global cooldown to suppress
  false positives.
- **Web app** — Camera (live feed + predictions), Label Studio (label clips),
  and Training (extract features + train the model). A separate public demo page
  shows highlights and a live behavior feed without exposing the camera.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm run install:all
```

Installs packages for the root, client, and server.

### 2. Configure the environment

Create `server/.env`:

```ini
# Email alerts (Gmail App Password — not your normal password)
EMAIL_USER=you@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
NOTIFY_TO=you@example.com
NOTIFY_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=10

# Dashboard login (wrap in quotes if it contains a # )
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-password"

# Camera agent — PC defaults shown; for a Raspberry Pi use v4l2 / /dev/video0
CAMERA_FORMAT=dshow
CAMERA_INPUT=video=Your Webcam Name
AGENT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=70
AGENT_MOTION_FLOOR=4
AGENT_ALERT_STREAK=3
```

Find your camera name (Windows): `ffmpeg -f dshow -list_devices true -i dummy`.

### 3. Build the client

```bash
cd client && npm run build
```

The server serves the built app, so everything runs on one port.

### 4. Run

Development (server + client dev server):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production / 24-7 (server, capture agent, and tunnel under pm2):

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
pm2 save
```

The dashboard is at http://localhost:3001. Log in with `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to reach
the camera, labeling, and training tabs. Without login you see the public demo.

## Using it

1. **Label** — record or import clips, then tag them in **Label Studio**
   (`Z` zoomies, `Y` yawn, `N` normal, `G` grooming, `S` standing).
2. **Train** — open **Training** and hit Start. It extracts MobileNet features,
   trains the classifier, shows a confusion matrix, and saves the model.
3. **Monitor** — the agent loads the saved model and runs live. Toggle
   **Monitoring** and **Email** from the dashboard header.

Clips the agent records during an alert are auto-labeled with the predicted
behavior (standard labels, same as a hand label) so they feed the next retrain.

## Deployment

Three processes run under pm2 and auto-start at login: `bunnycam-server`,
`bunnycam-agent`, and `bunnycam-tunnel` (Cloudflare). The tunnel maps a custom
domain to the local server over HTTPS, so the camera PC never exposes a port.

Security: cookie session auth (Secure over HTTPS), rate-limited login,
timing-safe password check, and a server-enforced private live stream.

### Raspberry Pi

The capture agent is platform-agnostic. To move from a PC to a Pi: clone, run
`npm install`, swap two `.env` lines (`CAMERA_FORMAT=v4l2`,
`CAMERA_INPUT=/dev/video0`), and start the same pm2 processes.

---

## Notes

- Recordings (`server/recordings/`), labels (`server/labels.json`), the model,
  backups, and `.env` are all git-ignored.
- Labels are written atomically and serialized, with `.bak` plus daily backups,
  so concurrent edits can't corrupt or wipe them.
- No third-party ML service — inference runs locally in TensorFlow.js.
